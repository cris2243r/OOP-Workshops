Throughout this workshop , I've gained a deeper understanding of fundamental programming concepts and their practical applications. Learning about classes, objects, and inheritance has been transformative, enabling me to create well-structured, reusable code. Constructors, destructors, and access specifiers have become essential tools in my coding arsenal.

Data encapsulation and validation have reinforced the importance of maintaining data integrity within objects. Dynamic memory allocation, operator overloading, and working with the C++ Standard Library have expanded my programming horizons.

Challenges such as compilation errors, memory management, and inheritance complexities have tested my problem-solving skills. Pointer errors, operator overloading mishaps, and input validation issues taught me valuable lessons in debugging and code robustness.

In the end, this workshop has not only equipped me with a strong foundation in OOP but also encouraged me to approach software development with a structured and adaptable mindset.
